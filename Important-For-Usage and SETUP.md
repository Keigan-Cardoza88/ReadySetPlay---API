**ReadySetPlay: A Performance Companion**

---

# Project Overview

ReadySetPlay is a complete performance companion app designed to enhance live performances with instant access to thousands of songs, dynamic features like autoscroll and transposition, and custom setlist management.

This project includes both:
- A backend server (FastAPI) that serves the song data.
- An Android frontend app (Kotlin on Android Studio Meerkat, SDK 35) that interacts with the API.

# How to Run

This project consists of two main parts: the backend API and the Android application.

## 1. Backend Setup (API Server)

- Open the `API` folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- Inside, you should find two files:
  - `api.py`
  - `requirements.txt`

- Install the required Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Navigate to the directory where `api.py` is located in your terminal. You must be inside the correct folder or else the server will not run.

- Run the FastAPI server using the following command:

  ```bash
  uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```

- This will start a local server accessible on your deviceâ€™s IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.2:8000`).

## 2. Android App Setup

- Open all other project files (excluding `api.py` and `requirements.txt`) in Android Studio Meerkat (SDK 35).

- Locate the Retrofit client file in the Android project and update the API base URL:

  ```kotlin
  private const val BASE_URL = "http://IPAddress:8000"
  ```

- Replace `IPAddress` with the local IP address of the device hosting the FastAPI server.

- Build and run the project by launching `MainActivity` or running the `app` module.

## 3. Notes

- Ensure that both the Android device and the machine hosting the API server are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- If running on a real Android device, ensure that network permissions are properly set.
